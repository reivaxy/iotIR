# iotIR
WebApp remote control and schedule IR controlled device

This is a place holder so that I don't forget to work on this :)

This Xiot module should be able to learn IR sequences from a remote controller (or use a library that provide them, it should exist somewhere), and offer to control devices through the Xiot webApp, offering scheduling programmation.

It will be equipped with a wide angle IR emitter (or several ones) to reach all devices in a room.

If it should learn IR codes, it will be equipped with an IR receptor. Optionnally it could also act as an IR repeated.
